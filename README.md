This project aims to predict loan eligibility using machine learning algorithms implemented in PySpark. The goal is to automate the loan approval process, improving accuracy and efficiency.

**Data Imputation:** Used mean/median imputation to handle missing values.

**Algorithms:** Implemented Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification.

**Validation:** Employed Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation to ensure model robustness.
